The approved question set, scale, scoring formula, result bands, and lifecyclerules are defined in docs/product/Assessment_Specification.md. Retakes andintentional result-history browsing are outside the initial-onboarding feature.

Coaching Plan

Generate an AI-personalized coaching plan as a core product capability, using a hybrid deterministic + LLM flow: deterministic product rules own eligibility, safety, grounding, validation, lifecycle, privacy, and persistence, while the LLM synthesizes bounded, bilingual, non-clinical plan copy from approved sources.

View plan

Activate plan through explicit user acceptance of a generated `PROPOSED` plan (`PROPOSED` -> `ACTIVE`).

Pause and richer lifecycle controls are deferred beyond the MVP.

Complete plan through minimal automatic lifecycle behavior after acceptance (`ACTIVE` <-> `COMPLETED`) based on action progress.
