/**
 * User-initiated account deletion (Consent §9, FR-031). DELETE /me/account is the
 * only surface for this flow; it is authenticated + EMAIL_VERIFIED (FR-002/FR-027).
 *
 * The endpoint NEVER returns answer/score/consent contents — only a
 * sanitized `{ confirmation_id, status, completed }`. `completed: false` (status
 * `partial`) means stores are still being cleaned up and access is already
 * disabled; the user is NOT told deletion is complete (Consent §12). A retry
 * safely continues deleting remaining rows (idempotent deletions).
 *
 * SECURITY: route guards are UX only (FR-028); the service enforces the deletion
 * contract and fail-closed semantics. No sensitive data is echoed or logged.
