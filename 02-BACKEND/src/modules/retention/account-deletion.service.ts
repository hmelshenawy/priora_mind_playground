/**
 * User-initiated account deletion (Consent policy §9, FR-031, research D10).
 *
 * Reuses the SAME per-module deletion contracts as the scheduled retention job so
 * there is exactly one deletion path per entity (data-model §14). The flow:
 *  1. Mark `UserAccount.deletedAt = now` on acceptance → blocks new processing
 *     (login/consent/assessment reject a deleted account) BEFORE any data is
 *     touched (Consent §9 "prevent new processing as soon as accepted").
 *  2. Delete per-module stores in referential order (assessment → coaching →
 *     profile → consent), collecting sanitized counters. Each deletion service is
 *     idempotent (`WHERE userId IN (...)`) so a retry only deletes remaining rows.
 *  3. If every category reports errors===0 → hard-delete the account row via
 *     AuthDeletionService.deleteAccountForUsers → status `completed`.
 *     If any category reports errors → KEEP the account (deletedAt stays set, access
 *     disabled) → status `partial`; the user is NOT told deletion is complete and a
 *     retry safely continues (Consent §12).
 *  4. Write one sanitized `DeletionLog` row (runKind `account_deletion`) — counters
 *     only, never email/answers/scores/consent contents (FR-030, research D7).
 *
 * Idempotency: a re-request for an already-fully-deleted user (no account row) is a
 * no-op returning `completed`; a re-request for a partially-deleted user continues
 * deleting remaining rows. No row is ever deleted twice (DELETE predicates).
 *
 * SECURITY: this service never reads or logs answer text, scores, or consent
 * contents — only integer counts come back from the deletion services.
