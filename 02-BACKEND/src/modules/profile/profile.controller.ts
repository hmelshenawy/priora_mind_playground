/**
 * Profile + onboarding endpoints (contracts/profile-onboarding.md). The
 * OnboardingService guard (T033) is the server-side authority for step ordering
 * (FR-033); route guards are UX only (FR-028). Security posture:
 *  - Every route requires a valid access token (JwtAuthGuard) AND EMAIL_VERIFIED
 *    (EmailVerifiedGuard) — backend-enforced (FR-002, FR-027/FR-028).
 *  - putProfile / putLanguage additionally require a granted consent record
 *    (the guard's 'profile' rule: emailVerified && consentGranted) — FR-006.
 *  - GET /onboarding/state is EMAIL_VERIFIED-only (no consent gate) so a
 *    pre-consent user can discover their next route (including the boundary).
 *  - No submitted value is echoed; validation errors carry field paths only.
